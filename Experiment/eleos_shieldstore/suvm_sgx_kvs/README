This is the microbenchmark used to test aptr effect on random access to an array of buffers.
It first allocates an array of requested size, and fills it with buffers of requested size (memsets them)
Allows testing for non-enclave, enclave, aptr, aptr without dirty bit, and direct aptrs

Random is generated by a pseudo random number generator (both for enclave and non enclave so it should be fair)

To run it specify:
1. Num of threads to act in the memory access
2. Item (buffer) size
3. Array size
4. Should do read test(1/0)
5. Should do write test(1/0)
6. Type (1=Native,2=Enclave,3=Aptr)
7. Number of random accesses to the array.
